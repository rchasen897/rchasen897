- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the guy who wrote the Funny or Die YouTube show "Zack Morris is Trash" was hired to write on the 2020 "Saved by the Bell" reboot because of his show? Through his web series, Dashiell Driscoll proved he knew "Saved by the Bell" and its characters so well that they hired him as a writer and co-host the watch-along podcast with Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris), "Zack to the Future."
